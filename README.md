# Perceiver-Actor^2: A Multi-Task Transformer for Bimanual Robotic Manipulation Tasks

[![Code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-black)](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

This work extends previous work [PerAct](https://peract.github.io) as well as
[RLBench](https://sites.google.com/view/rlbench) for bimanual manipulation
tasks.

The repository and documentation are still work in progress.

For the latest updates, see: [bimanual.github.io](https://bimanual.github.io)


## Installation

### Prerequisites

The code PerAct^2 is built-off the [PerAct](https://peract.github.io) which itself is
built on the [ARM repository](https://github.com/stepjam/ARM) by James et al.
The prerequisites are the same as PerAct or ARM. 

#### 1. Environment


Install miniconda if not already present on the current system.
You can use `scripts/install_conda.sh` for this step:

```bash

sudo apt install curl 

curl -L -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

SHELL_NAME=`basename $SHELL`
eval "$($HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.${SHELL_NAME} hook)"
conda init ${SHELL_NAME}
conda install mamba -c conda-forge
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

Next, create the rlbench environment and install the dependencies

```bash
conda create -n rlbench python=3.8
conda activate rlbench
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```


#### 2. Dependencies

You need to setup RBench, PyRep, and YARR. 
You  can use `scripts/install_dependencies.sh` to do so
See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) for details.

```bash
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```



### Pre-Generated Datasets


Please checkout the website for [pre-generated RLBench
demonstrations](https://bimanual.github.io). If you directly use these
datasets, you don't need to run `tools/bimanual_data_generator.py` from
RLBench. Using these datasets will also help reproducibility since each scene
is randomly sampled in `data_generator_bimanual.py`.
